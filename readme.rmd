# Artificial Neural Network for handwritten digits recognition

(Software written and tested using Octave 3.8.1)

- Script file: neural_net.m
Here you can modify the structure of the network, input data, number of epochs,
mini-batch size and the learning rate.

- loadMNISTImages.m, loadMNISTLabels.m
Helper functions used to load the data
Downloaded from  http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/resources/mnistHelper.zip

- network.m:
Used to define the structure of the network and to initialize weights and biases

- SGD.m:
Stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
Used to train and to evaluate the network.

- update_mini_batch.m:
Function to update a single mini-batch. Called by SGD.m

- backpropagation.m:
Backpropagation algorithm. Calles by update_mini_batch.m

- evaluate.m:
Function to evaluate the algorithm after the training. Called by SGD.m

- feedforward.m:
Function to compute the output of the network. Called by evaluate.m
